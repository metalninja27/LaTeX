\section{38.3 Exercises}

\subsection{38.3.1}

First we need to find out the parameterization for $C$. So give $x=2\cos(t)$ and $y=2\sin(t)$, but in order to ensure that $x$ remains nonnegative and we only trace out a half circle, we give the parameter the range $t\in[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$.

The arclength element $ds$ for this problem is $\sqrt{(-2\sin(t))^2+(2\cos(t))^2}dt = 2dt$ (this parameterization is a natural one). So then we may substitute in the line integral like so:
$$16\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^2(t)\cos(t)dt = \frac{32}{3}$$

\subsection{38.3.2}

Recall that a line segment with initial point $\vec{r}_0$ and terminal point $\vec{r}_1$ are most easily parameterized as $\vec{r}(t) = (1-t)\vec{r}_0 + t\vec{r}_1$, for $0\leq t \leq 1$. Apply this definition to the line segment given in the problem to find that $\vec{r}(t) = \langle bt,(1-t)a \rangle$, for $t$ in that same interval as before.
Then find $ds$:
$$ds = \sqrt{(-a)^2 + (b)^2} = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$

Then the integral becomes
$$\int_C x\sin(y)ds \to \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\int_0^1 bt\sin((1-t)a)dt$$

Give $u=1-t$ so that $t=1-u$ and $du=-dt$. Change the bounds as well (they actually remain unchanged):
$$\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\int_0^1 (1-u)b\sin(au)du \to \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\int_0^1 \left(b\sin(au)-bu\sin(au)\right)du$$
$$ = \frac{b}{a}\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\left[1-\frac{\sin(a)}{a}\right]$$

\subsection{38.3.4}

We are given the parameterization for the curve $C$ from the get go, and it is easy to deduce that the range of $t$ is from $0$ to $1$. Then the arclength element $ds$ is given by $\sqrt{(1)^2 + (2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2}dt = \sqrt{9t^4 + 4t^2 + 1}dt$.

Substitute into the line integral and resolve:
$$\int_0^1 (2t + 9t^3)(\sqrt{9t^4 + 4t^2 + 1})dt \to \frac{1}{4}\int_1^{14}\sqrt{u}du = \frac{1}{6}\left(14^{\frac{3}{2}}-1\right)$$

\subsection{38.3.18}

We seek to take a line integral over the path given by an arc of the parabola in the problem where the integrand is the linear mass density.

Give $t=y$ and $x = \frac{t^2}{2a}$. Since $0\leq \frac{t^2}{2a} \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (from substitution) it is apparent that $-a\leq t \leq a$. Find the arclength element $ds$ as $\sqrt{(1)^2 + \left(\frac{t}{a}\right)^2}dt = \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{a^2+t^2}$. Then we may substitute to find the following:
$$\frac{1}{a}\int_{-a}^a |t|\sqrt{a^2+t^2} dt \to \frac{1}{a}\int_{a^2}^{2a^2}u^{\frac{1}{2}}du = \frac{2}{3}a^2(2\sqrt{2}-1)$$


The evaluation of the integral may be done in the piecewise manner or by symmetry (and substitution) as above.
